ðŸ“ˆ Basic Fitting with MATLAB
============================

â„¹ This repository contains the material required for the training on basic polynomial fitting with MATLAB.

The math to solve the problem resorts to [Least-Squares Fitting][1]. 

To support the hands-on, the data points are generated by means of a **Simulink model** representing a Wheaststone bridge along with the necessary circuitry to measure the pressure readouts acquired from a strain gauge sensor. This approach is motivated by the link to the physical experiments needed to perform the calibration of the sensors.
